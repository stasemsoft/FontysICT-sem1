# Softwarematerial - Overview

## Introduction

This is a collection of (open) software material from the starting semester FHICT (Fontys University of Applied Sciences for ICT). It is publicly accessible to all and free of copyright. It has been created and collected over the years by teachers, with additions here and there by students! FHICT refers to this material from a canvas course, there is the FHICT-specific info there, while these github pages are fairly FHICT-independent.

## Structure of this material

In the theory material we distinguish:

+ `Tutorial`: practical steps, learning oriented.
+ `How-to guide`: practical steps, problem oriented.
+ `Discussion`: theoretical, understanding oriented.
+ `Reference`: theoretical, information oriented. Accurate and complete.

The assignments can be divided into:

+ `Training` (formerly exercises): `finger exercises`, belong to a piece of theory to practice, but are not to be used as evidence to convince your teacher.
+ `Competition`: to convince your teacher that you not only understand it but also do it, you are going to make up your own assignments, vary and expand on existing ones!

See [more explanation](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/meta) on the principles.

## First Aid when Getting Stuck

+ [How-to](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/basic/howto): Technical-content questions can be found in the How-to. Is your answer not there? Let's hear it! (Even if you already found the answer yourself - thanks!)
+ [how to use a Tutorial](docs/process/howtoLookAtATutorial.md)

+ [Frequently Asked Questions](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/FAQ): If you have questions about the course at FHICT: check out the FAQ first Whether others had the same question as well.
+ [some more really powerful help can be found here](https://chat.openai.com/chat)
+ [or here](https://www.perplexity.ai), but be sure you understand the outcome!!; furthermore be explicit about using AI-help!!

## Parts

### 1. Computational Thinking

The way of thinking, good to know something about.... Originally used as material for making knowledge with each other and with the teacher. Works best while discussing with marker at whiteboard.

+ [Computational Thinking](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/computational)

---

### 2. Toolbox Basics: Basic concepts of programming without objects

An introduction to programming (still without objects).

+ [Toolbox Basics](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/basic/)

---

### 3. Toolbox: Programming Objects and Classes

Getting started with Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

+ [Toolbox: Objects and Classes](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/objects/)

### 4. Software Engineering

This covers some non-programming aspects that a beginning software engineer should know and be able to do.

### 5. Learning material Artificial Intelligence

In the 1950's programming and artificial intelligence started more or less  started to take form at the same time. For decennia programming was the most used way to instruct machines what to do, but since 2023 artificial intelligence started to fly... It's totally changing the way computer programs are built.
