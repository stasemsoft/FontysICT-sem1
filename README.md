# Software Material - Overview

## Introduction

This is a collection of open-source software material for the starting semester at FHICT (Fontys University of Applied Sciences for ICT). The material is publicly accessible and free of copyright. It has been created and collected over the years by teachers, with contributions from students. FHICT references this material from a Canvas course (where FHICT-specific information is located), while these GitHub pages are fairly FHICT-independent.

## Quick Start

**New to programming?** Start here:

- [Install Visual Studio](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/process/infoVisualStudioInstallatie) - Set up your development environment
- [Compare yourself to personas](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/personas/intro) - Find out where you fit based on your experience level
- [Read the FAQ](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/FAQ) - Common questions answered

## Structure of this Material

The theory material is organized into these types:

- `Tutorial`: Practical steps, learning-oriented. Shows how to get started with immediate results.
- `How-to guide`: Practical steps, problem-oriented. Helps you solve specific issues.
- `Discussion`: Theoretical, understanding-oriented. Explores concepts and ideas.
- `Reference`: Theoretical, information-oriented. Accurate and complete documentation.

Assignments are divided into:

- `Training` (formerly exercises): Practice exercises that help you master theory, but are not meant as proof of competency for your teacher.
- `Challenges`: To demonstrate competency, create your own assignments, vary existing ones, and expand on them!

See [more explanation](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/meta) on the principles.

## Learning Content

### 1. Computational Thinking

Understanding how to think computationally - a valuable foundation. Originally designed for collaborative learning with teachers. Works best when discussed together with a whiteboard.

- [Computational Thinking](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/computational)

---

### 2. Toolbox Basics: Programming without Objects

An introduction to programming fundamentals (before diving into objects).

- [Toolbox Basics](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/basic/)

---

### 3. Toolbox: Programming Objects and Classes

Getting started with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

- [Toolbox: Objects and Classes](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/objects/)

---

### 4. Software Engineering

Essential non-programming aspects that every beginning software engineer should know and be able to do.

### 5. Artificial Intelligence Learning Material

Programming and artificial intelligence emerged around the same time in the 1950s. For decades, programming was the primary way to instruct machines, but since 2023, artificial intelligence has taken off... It's fundamentally changing how computer programs are built.
