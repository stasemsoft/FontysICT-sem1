# Softwarematerial - Overview


## Introduction

This is a collection of (open) software material from the starting semester FHICT (Fontys University of Applied Sciences for ICT). It is publicly accessible to all and free of copyright. It has been created and collected over the years by teachers, with additions here and there by students! FHICT refers to this material from a canvas course, there is the FHICT-specific info there, while these github pages are fairly FHICT-independent.

## Structure of this material

In the theory material we distinguish:

+ `Tutorial`: practical steps, learning oriented.
+ `How-to guide`: practical steps, problem oriented.
+ `Discussion`: theoretical, understanding oriented.
+ `Reference`: theoretical, information oriented. Accurate and complete.

The assignments can be divided into:

+ `Training` (formerly exercises): `finger exercises`, belong to a piece of theory to practice, but are not to be used as evidence to convince your teacher.
+ `Competition`: to convince your teacher that you not only understand it but also do it, you are going to make up your own assignments, vary and expand on existing ones!

See [more explanation](https://stasemsoft.github.io/softwarematerial/docs/meta) on the principles.

## Parts

### 1. Computational Thinking

The way of thinking, good to know something about.... Originally used as material for making knowledge with each other and with the teacher. Works best while discussing with marker at whiteboard.
