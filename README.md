## Introduction

This is a collection of open-source software material for the starting semester at Fontys ICT (Fontys University of Applied Sciences for ICT). The material is publicly accessible and free of copyright. It has been created and collected over the years by teachers, with contributions from students. Fontys ICT references this material from a Canvas course (where Fontys ICT-specific information is located), while these GitHub pages are fairly Fontys ICT-independent.

## 📖 Structure of this Material

Understanding how this material is organized will help you navigate it effectively.

### 📘 Theory Material Types

The theory material is organized into these types:

- **`Tutorial`**: Practical steps, learning-oriented. Shows how to get started with immediate results.
- **`How-to guide`**: Practical steps, problem-oriented. Helps you solve specific issues.
- **`Discussion`**: Theoretical, understanding-oriented. Explores concepts and ideas.
- **`Reference`**: Theoretical, information-oriented. Accurate and complete documentation.

### 📝 Assignment Types

Assignments are divided into:

- **`Training`** (formerly exercises): Practice exercises that help you master theory, but are not meant as proof of competency for your teacher.
- **`Challenges`**: To demonstrate competency, create your own assignments, vary existing ones, and expand on them!

See [more explanation](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/meta) on the principles.

## 📚 Learning Content

Your learning journey follows this progression:

### 1️⃣ Computational Thinking

Understanding how to think computationally - a valuable foundation. Originally designed for collaborative learning with teachers. Works best when discussed together with a whiteboard.

➡️ [Start learning Computational Thinking](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/computational)

---

### 2️⃣ Toolbox Basics: Programming without Objects

An introduction to programming fundamentals (before diving into objects).

➡️ [Start learning Toolbox Basics](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/basic/)

---

### 3️⃣ Toolbox: Programming Objects and Classes

Getting started with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

➡️ [Start learning Objects and Classes](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/objects/)

---

### 4️⃣ Software Engineering

Essential non-programming aspects that every beginning software engineer should know and be able to do.
