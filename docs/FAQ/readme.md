# Frequently Asked Questions

Here questions and answers are included that may be of interest to anyone working on this material.

## Errata

Module: S Orientation Product Proof of Concept,
Under 'Lecture material' there is a link 'Exercises: Arrays', which refers to a wrong place. Must be:
name: 'softwarematerial/basic'
url: 'https://stasemsoft.github.io/softwarematerial/docs/basic/'

## Do I have to use C#?

You need to convince your teacher that you master the required skills at the required level. In part, this may be possible with pieces of code in other languages and environments: Talk to your teacher!



A concept like 'methods with parameters and returns values' can be shown in a lot of languages. A teacher may ask questions about types (in statically typed languages).

Always consult with your teacher. For diving really into software you always have to discuss with your teacher, where the teacher may still require C#.

And if there is one student on the team with a lot of experience who prefers a different language and tries to convince his teammates?
What is important though is that everyone from the team who goes into S should be able to explain the software of the protask (not on every detail, but certainly globally). If the whole team's behind it and that one student realizes that he has to help the others, that you have to work together, there's talk about it.

## What's the first day look like?

Purpose: to meet: students among themselves and also with the teacher. We want them to get mixed up, talk, argue. At the same time we want to introduce them to typical software ideas & co. Under the title Computational Thinking are a number of challenges that students can work with on the first day without needing a development environment. The whiteboard pen is presented to them by FHICT, for which we ask them to draw schematics and models (not with a digital tool). They need that marker later here and there, so press the heart they keep (ISSD likes to sell them new ones, if they lose him...).

Everything is on the Homepage and in the Modules, there are no separate kick-off slides. Depending on your own style you walk through it or put yourself to reading. Demand Based: Let them look for themselves! A little unrest may well arise in the classroom... ;-)

## How am I gonna get the semester?

For some students it is not clear what is expected of them. The page " pertaining to learning outcomes" (for a link see the Home page of your S1-SOFT course) is not clear enough for all cases. Answering the question (asked by lecturer): 'What did you do with the feedback?' is important here! To get and capture feedback (feed pulse) you need to talk to your teacher.

## Where can I report found errors in the material?

The material is in git (on GitHub, to be precise): prefer to correct errors via the 'improve this page' at the bottom of the pages! The content material can be found at: https://stasemsoft.github.io/softwarematerial/ .
