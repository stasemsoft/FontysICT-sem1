# AI, GenAI, artificial intelligence

## What is AI?

- When we talk about AI or Artificial Intelligence we mean everything done
by a 'machine' that  looks like there is intelligence involved.
These can be a lot of different things, like for example a
Personal Assistent that helps you get your work done, or  
Spell and Grammer checking in text editors.
If you want more examples ask the question "Please give me some examples of AI"
in [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) .
- In the following we provide some links to places we think are helpful in
discovering AI and/or GenAI. Have fun!

## What is GenAI?

- Why not ask [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) ?

## Some background: LLM, GPT, Transformers

- Great interactive site (a workshop in itself!): [https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/](https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/artificial-intelligence/ai.html)
- A nice overview of how it evolved: [How AI learned to Talk (30 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFS90-FX6pg)
- [But what is a GPT? (3Blue1Brown, youtube, 30 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M)

## Prompt & co

- [Prompting basics](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/basics)
- [Look for course with 'Prompting' in name: https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/)

## Hands-on: RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation

- [IBM, Marina Danilevsky (7 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D1OfcDW1M)
- [https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ Great resource for courses!](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/)

## Adviced Resources to look at regularly

- [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) lots of models here:
Text-to-image, Image-to-text, Text-to-video, Visual questioning answering,
Image classification, and lots and lots more!  
Huggingface is a site to look at regularly: new models everyday!
