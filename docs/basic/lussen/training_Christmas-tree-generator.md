#Training - Christmas Tree Generator

  

Create a method that allows you to create a Christmas tree of a certain height in a certain color at any position on the screen. It should also be possible to include the symbol. In the screenshot below, we have given the Christmas trees the following parameters/properties:

  

| Color | Height | Left/x | Top/y | Symbol |

|-------|---------|-------|--------|----------------|  

| Red | 10 | 10 | 10 | 8  |

| Green | 5 | 20 | 5 | 5 |

  

Use a _Console_ application.  

Tip: use **Console.ReadKey()** to prevent the program from shutting down again immediately after startup.

## Roadmap  

1. Print a certain character on the screen  

2. Have a horizontal line of several characters printed  

3.Have a horizontal line of multiple characters printed at any position  

4. Have a horizontal line of multiple characters printed at random position in a specific color  

5. Create a Christmas tree shape

6. Multiple Christmas trees

  

## Extensions

- Level ** Fill the Christmas tree with the characters of a given string, so e.g. “abc” then the whole Christmas tree will be filled with these letters  

- Level ** Ask the user at what position to place the Christmas tree  

- Level *** Place any number of Christmas trees with all different properties in a random position, however entirely within the window.  

- Level ** Decorate the Christmas tree with randomly hung colored baubles (a letter O). The baubles must not hang too close together, there must be at least 2 squares between them.  

- Level *** Create a graphic in WinForms that uses Windows GDI Graphics.
