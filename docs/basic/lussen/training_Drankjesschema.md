# Training - For - Beverage Schedule.

  

Create an application that allows you to add drinks to a **Listbox**. As a user, you should be able to enter the type of drink, for example Red Bull or Whisky. You should also be able to enter the number of that type of drink, for example 1, 3 or 6. Pressing the button will add the correct number of drinks to the list. Put a sequential number after the type of drink. Suppose you want to add three drinks. Then “whiskey 1”, “whiskey 2” and “whiskey 3” will be added successively to the list.

  

Also keep track of the total number of drinks at the bottom of the list.
