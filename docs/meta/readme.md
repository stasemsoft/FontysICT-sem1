# Starting points for this software material

This is a collection (open) software material from Fontys ICT (Fontys University of ICT). Find this material

Types:
The idea is that the material is increasingly structured on ideas by Daniele Procida:
Based on the youtube video [What nobody tells you about documentation (Daniele Procida) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg). See also [the divio-site on documentation]https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/). Daniele proposes the following types:

* `Tutorial`: practical steps, learning oriented. Show how to get started. Minimum necessary explanation. Immediate sense of achievement.
* `How-to guide`: practical steps, problem oriented.
* `Discussion`: theoretical, understanding oriented.
* `Reference`: theoretical, information oriented. Accurate and complete.

At Fontys ICT we distinguish further

* "Training" (formerly _exercises_): 'finger exercises', these are meant to practice a piece of theory in practice, but not to use to convince your teacher.
* "Challenges": To convince your teacher that you don't only get it but also do it, you're going to come up with your own assignments, vary and expand on existing assignments!

Further principles:

* The focus is on the concepts: We want to teach someone for example how and why to create a Class, not specifically in C# or Visual Studio! 
* Wherever possible we keep it programming language agnostic.
* For learning the OOP concepts the GUI (Graphical User Interface) is less important, so this material does not spend a lot of time on it. 
* only copyright-free material in these repos!
* Everyone is encouraged to give tips to improve! The pages all have an 'improve this page' link below!
