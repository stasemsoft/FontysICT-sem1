# Visual Studio Installation

## Recommended: Visual Studio Community (Windows)

**Download and install:** [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) (free)

During installation, select **".NET desktop development"** workload. This is sufficient for the starting semester.

**Why this version?** Many examples in this material use WinForms, which works best in Visual Studio for Windows. Teachers and fellow students also typically use this version.

### Alternative Options

- **FHICT Online Workplace:** [portal.fhict.nl/Studentenplein](https://portal.fhict.nl/Studentenplein) - Visual Studio online without local Windows installation
- **Via FHICT Portal:** Also available through [Student Square](https://portal.fhict.nl/Studentenplein/SitePages/Home.aspx) under 'Software'

### Mac Users

- **Recommended:** Boot Camp or Virtual Machine (VMWare/Parallels) with Windows + Visual Studio for Windows
- **Alternative:** [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) (supports WinForms, free for students via JetBrains)
- **Note:** Visual Studio for Mac doesn't support WinForms. Visual Studio Code also doesn't support WinForms.

### Visual Studio Code

Not recommended for beginners: different workflow, no WinForms support. Excellent editor, but you'll need to figure things out yourself.
