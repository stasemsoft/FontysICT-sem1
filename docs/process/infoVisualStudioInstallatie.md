# Visual Studio Installation

## Recommended: Visual Studio Community (Windows)

**Download and install:** [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) (free)

During installation, select **".NET desktop development"** workload. This is sufficient for the starting semester.

**Why this version?** Many examples in this material use WinForms, which works best in Visual Studio for Windows. Teachers and fellow students also typically use this version.

### Mac Users

**Recommended:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Free, cross-platform code editor.

**Note:** Visual Studio Code doesn't support WinForms. If you need WinForms for assignments, consider:
- Boot Camp or Virtual Machine (VMWare/Parallels) with Windows + Visual Studio for Windows
