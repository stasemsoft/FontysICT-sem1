# How to solve a programmer/programming problem


![fig:UPEAVL](figures/UPEAVL.png "Programmer Search Scheme")

# A discussion *by step*:

## Understand
To solve a problem you must first Understand what the problem is!
- What is my starting point? An error? An exception? A bug? A feature on a wishlist?
- Do I understand the problem for which I am seeking a solution?
- Do I know all the relevant terms?


## (Create) Plan
Create a plan:
- What am I going to look for?
- How?
- What search terms?
- Which search engine?


## Execute Plan
Execute plan:
- Use search engine according to plan.
- Select and read.


## Adjust
- Name your sources.
- Adjust so you understand the result.


## Validate Result
Check the result:
- Did I find what I was looking for?
- Does this solve the problem?
- Is the solution (always) correct or are there cases where it doesn't work for?



## Learn/Look back
Learn:
- What did I learn?
- Now that you know an answer: could you have found this faster, easier, more elegant? Did you look for the right thing?
- Suppose I come across a similar problem again, can I reach a solution faster?
- Should I record any of it? If so, where?


The idea essentially comes from *How to solve it?* by didactician *Polya*.
It started as a so-called 100-hour survey by Coen at Fontys ICT.
Many colleagues gave feedback to develop and make better.
This included some alternatives, such as
