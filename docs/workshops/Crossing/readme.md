# Crossing

Example (console app) with a class *Crossing* that can have *TrafficLights* that may not be on *green* at the same time.

As a starting point, you can use the training command *TrafficLight* and expand from there. See [training_Enum_TrafficLight](../../objects/training_Enum_TrafficLight.md).
